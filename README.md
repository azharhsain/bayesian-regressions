Templates for Running Bayesian Regressions

## What are Bayesian Regressions?

First, they have nothing to do with learning, have no priors to be updated (in my examples), and will never show an explicit Bayes Rule.

Non-parametric parameter uncertainty.

## The templates

 - Multivariate regression
 - Fixed effects regression
 - Robust noise regression
 - Constrained parameter regression
