Templates for Running Bayesian Regressions

## What are Bayesian Regressions?

First, they have nothing to do with learning, have no priors to be updated (in my examples), and will never show an explicit Bayes Rule.

The point of Bayesian Regressions is to get non-parametric parameter uncertainty.  The distribution of each parameter will be represented by random draws from its distribution.

## The templates

 - Multivariate regression
 - Fixed effects regression
 - Robust noise regression
 - Constrained parameter regression
